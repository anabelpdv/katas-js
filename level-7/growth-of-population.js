 * Task:
 * In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population 
 * regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come 
 * to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or 
 * equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?
 * More generally given parameters:
 * p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to surpass)
 * the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population 
 * greater or equal to p.
 * aug is an integer, percent a positive or null number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)
 * Examples:
 * nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15
 * nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10

/*************************************** my solution *************************************/
function nbYear(p0, percent, aug, p) {
  let years = 0; 
  while (p0 < p){
    p0 += p0 * percent/100 + aug;
    years++;
  }
  return years;
}


/*********************************** the best solution ***********************************/
function nbYear(p0, percent, aug, p) {
  for(var y = 0; p0 < p; y++) p0 = p0 * (1 + percent / 100) + aug;
  return y;
